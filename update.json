{"version":2.8,"details":"2.8\nThis is the last version of FileCentipede2.\nThe development of the next major version 3.0 has started. \nIf you have any feature requests, please post them on https://github.com/filecxx/FileCentipede/discussions/402\n\n\nChanges:\nBrowser extensions up to 1.8\nLanguage file \"ru_RU.lang\" updated.\n\nFixed:\nURL directory parse error, such as \"http://localhost/a=1&b=/dir/file\".\nThe FTP task becomes stuck in the stopping state if the connection fails.\nUnable to receive FTP file list when remote FTP server sends code 226 before sending the file list. \nThe browser extension shows \"Send failed\" when getting an URL that starts with \"blob:\".\nThe browser extension sometimes fails to obtain the cookie information for a URL.\nA new strategy for downloading protected m3u8 segments.\nIn some cases, the downloaded file is m3u8 content instead of a video.\nm3u8 png segments.\nm3u8 parsing segment URL lost the last character when the m3u8 file did not end with a newline.\nUse \"filename*=UTF-8\" as the preferred filename instead of \"filename=\".\nThe \"Blocks\" from the detail panel are displayed reversely when the HTTP task is not resumable.\nUnlocked variables caused the filec process to crash.\nThe settings from the 'Update-dialog' cannot be saved.\nDisplay an error message when the remote client fails to connect.\nIncrease the SSH maximum connect timeout to 120 seconds, rather than the current 12 seconds.\nfilec crashes if the remote HTTP response headers include both 'content-range' and 'transfer-encoding' at the same time.\nWhen downloading multiple files with the same file name but different contents simultaneously, the automatic renaming function may potentially cause errors in writing to the files due to a lack of locking, indirectly causing filec to crash.","uri_mac_x64":"","uri_win_x64":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:1164bafdd99c04b24380a1cebab5acef53376e8e&xt=urn:btmh:12208247680ace07586e9d52b43a2bc6c9f3ec6ee8bfe2911058d035294695432515&dn=filecxx_2.8_win_x64.zip","checksum_win_x64":1444287724,"checksum_verify_linux_x64":"N3YFM7IkW7PG/SBGROSQXwKToCiovnGMrhXQZRViGzApgIPhZKwAeSII8WNr9l1kLlJyV+TuR9ypgOohV1sgGTEDEHmT/K/Iy1LDNmnTBer9yuEqIXJxgItylFLcejWv6n6ilc/XRgYtNP0B3vcoraP82o1Otdbm0DdNvFP3q3A=","checksum_verify_win_x64":"hAfsZdDftDMl4M2BS4kWnK/mccS0tmb3um3yhm7pafALwe2yLEMrNBvSzHlliBLWk/K+rxgMmE2OluksxbI8PbOkfHkwKpfw3QRIchgegTqWFFDcIRIA4a12fr1JUtPyjTBJwEkQnyJ/PClLPPdM8xkXwqUzHarYqjRDVezBmaI=","checksum_mac_x64":0,"checksum_verify_mac_x64":"LAN1lMzad8m4/Zwt2EV1cqY1OFPZYA/A3vgDp+Pdn7GXXZzgOmFHcadrPie4T1RALyfNb7koX3YNgvWqDRjoLL8zwrsa5Bn87/o/tixW+td469yz9FIqGDI19z604mP15DWLiINQiYvssNkQ3tr0UzgsXYSHP61u9mAGtG9ek4c=","uri_linux_x64":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:a45cfb103317fa119590f3c68d9b38d3048c626d&xt=urn:btmh:12209604809a153a02b0f23813521233d933dc2862d1efcc900ea3b0295118dfcfa8&dn=filecxx_2.8_linux_x64.zip","checksum_linux_x64":216903845}
